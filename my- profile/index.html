    <p> Hey!! My name is Ewan Radde. I am a hispano-french living in the South of France. If travelling is one of my favorite things to do, I do love to chill at home or hang out with my friends. I love to keep myself open-minded that's why I read a lot and put an interest in many domains. Being a fan of sport, I play tennis and football. 
    I am currently in Singapore where I study a degree in BBA at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School</a>

     <strong>Travels</strong>
  		I love travelling, discovering new cultures, meeting new people,etc. In my opinion, seeing the world is more educational than a high school or college class. When we travel, we have the possibility of learning a new language, a new cuisine, aspects of a different culture, or even acquiring a deeper appreciation of faith or spirituality.  
  	</p> 
    <p> Also, I feel like travelling helps to open your mind. You realize that there’s no one way to live life. Especially, meeting people from other places will show you that your world view isn’t the same as everyone else’s.
    </p>
    <p>  I personally prefer to visit places where the weather is warm, such as Costa Rica, Bali, Spain, Thailand, Peru... Nonethless, since I love skiing and the snow as well as exploring different environments and places I tend to like all the places I visit. I went for many years (and I will still go) to Risoul, a ski resort in the French Alps. I consider myself really lucky to have seen so many different landscape around the world. Travelling it's a wealth that lasts forever.
